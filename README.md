**NOTE: this check has moved to the datadog core integrations [repo](https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core/tree/master/supervisord) and installs with the agent**


A simple supervisord process and uptime check. Check collects the following:

1. Service check on each process (Critical, OK, Unknown).
2. Uptime of each process.
3. Process count by status.

Getting Started
---------------
1. Install or upgrade to Dataodg agent >= 5.0.

    port:localhost:9001
    username:user
    password:pass
    ```
3. Reload supervisor.
4. Clone this repository.
5. Install `xmlrpclib`.
